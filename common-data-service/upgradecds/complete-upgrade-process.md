# Step 3: Complete the upgrade process for your existing database to CDS for Apps

After you have upgraded and verified your apps and flows, its time to complete
the database upgrade.

## Complete the upgrade

This is the final step in the process and initiates a complete upgrade of the
database. This step involves downtime of the database, including the apps and
flows associated with it. Expect this step to take several hours, depending on
the size of your database.

To complete the database upgrade, an environment administrator must go to the
[PowerApps admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com/) and select **Publish
upgrade**.
