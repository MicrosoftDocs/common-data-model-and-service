# Resolve Context

Holds information about current executing resolution context, including configuration for the logging subsystem. This object is initialized by CdmCorpusDefinition upon its instantiation and can be adjusted with subsequent call to [CdmCorpusDefinition.SetEventCallback](../cdm/corpus.md#methods) API.

```csharp
public class ResolveContext extends CdmCorpusContext
```
