# Event Callback

The event callback represents the callback object used in [CdmCorpusDefinition.SetEventCallback(...)](../cdm/corpus.md#methods) and allows host application to register itself for the purpose of receiving messages issued by the SDK during its operation. Following snippet demonstrates its use:

```csharp
corpus.SetEventCallback(new EventCallback
    {
        Invoke = (CdmStatusLevel statusLevel, string message) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{statusLevel}: {message}");
                // ... or send the log to your own logging component
            }
    },
    CdmStatusLevel.Warning);
```

Note that the event callback will receive *all* messages of specified level and above that the SDK generates across all API calls, which may make it difficult to understand what happens in one single API call. If you are interested in analyzing or reacting to events generated by a *single* API call, you may use [EventList](eventlist.md) object in the corpus context.

```csharp
public class EventCallback
```
