# API Reference

## Overview

In this section, you'll find the specifications for the public Common Data Model APIs. There are three sections to this API reference:

* [Object Model](cdm/cdm.md) contains the specifications for the core Common Data Model object model APIs.

* [Storage](storage/storage.md) contains the specifications for the file-system abstraction layer through which Common Data Model metadata files can be read or written.

* [Utilities](utilities/utilities.md) contains the specifications for the utility APIs that are commonly used.

>[!NOTE]
>This API reference only contains the specifications for public APIs. Do not use the Internal APIs. Internal APIs are marked with the `internal` access modifier in C#, the `@Deprecated` tag in Java, a leading underscore in Python, and the `@internal` tag in TypeScript.
