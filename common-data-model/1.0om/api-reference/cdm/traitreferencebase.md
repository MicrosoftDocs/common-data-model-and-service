# Trait Reference Base

*SDK version 1.2*

This is the base interface for trait and trait group references and doesn't introduce any new properties or methods. It's extended by *CdmTraitReference* and *CdmTraitGroupReference*.

```csharp
public interface CdmTraitReferenceBase extends CdmObjectReferenceBase
```
*This interface is substituted with a regular class in Python.*
