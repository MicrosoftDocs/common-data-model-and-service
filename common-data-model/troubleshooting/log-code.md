# Guidance on SDK error and warning codes

The following list describes the possible error and warning codes logged by the Common Data Model SDK with their description.
These error and warning codes are defined in [CdmLogcode](../1.0om/api-reference/cdm/logcode.md) enum class.

## Errors 
|Enum|Description|
|---|---|
|**ErrAdapterNotFound**|SDK attempted to obtain adapter associated with namespace that the given document is part of, but could not find it. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound
|**ErrDocAdapterNotFound**|SDK attempted to obtain adapter associated with the namespace that the given document is part of, but could not find it. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound.
|**ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure**|SDK was unable to save documents containing definitions of local or partition-specialized entities. This error is usually reported after errors ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound, and ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocEntityReplacementFailure**|This error occurs during resolution of an entity if the document where the resolved entity is going to be saved already exists. To avoid this error, you can specify non-conflicting resolved document name (if calling `CreateResolvedEntityAsync`) or document rename pattern (if calling `CreateResolvedManifestAsync`).
|**ErrDocImportSavingFailure**|SDK was unable to save one or more documents imported by the document currently being saved. This error is usually reported after errors ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound, and ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocIsNotFolder**|This error occurs when one of the entities in a manifest being resolved is part of a document that is not placed in any CDM virtual folder. This situation may occur when composing a new manifest and adding entities but omitting to place entity documents to a CDM folder before the resolution is started.
|**ErrDocPartitionSchemaSavingFailure**|SDK logs this error when it fails to save partition schema document. This error is usually reported after ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound, or ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocSubManifestSavingFailure**|SDK logs this error when it fails to save submanifest document. This error usually reported after ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound, or ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocSymbolNotFound**|This error is logged by FetchObjectAsync API when it is not able to find the specified object. This error may happen if the supplied path is incorrect, or the document on the target file-system cannot be loaded.
|**ErrDocWrtDocNotfound**|SDK logs this error when resolving an entity if WrtDoc property in the ResolveOptions object is not set. The WRT stands for "with regard to" and is the document SDK should use as a point of reference when resolving relative paths and symbol names encountered in the definitions.
|**ErrEntityCreationFailed**|This error is logged during addition of an entity definition to a manifest if the supplied entity object does not have Owner set. An 'owner' for an entity definition object should be a document, therefore make sure to add entity definition to a document before the entity is added to a manifest.
|**ErrIndexFailed**|This error is reported during document indexing process. A common situation is if a document object exists that has not been added to any folder object yet, indicated by the preceding ErrValdnMissingDoc error.
|**ErrInvalidPath**|SDK logs this error when attempting to fetch child folders for the given path, but detects discrepancy between the indicated path names and the folder objects names, for example, path is "/foo/bar" but folders objects are defined as folder("foo").folder("qux").
|**ErrObjectWithoutOwnerFound**|SDK logs this error during searching for entity to entity relationships when object containing the target entity is missing.
|**ErrPartitionFileModTimeFailure**|This error is reported during computation of the last modified time of a partition, when SDK accesses file-system via applicable adapter but encounters an exception, usually I/O related. Possible reasons can be wrong partition paths, wrong adapter configurations, access permissions, temporary network failures, and others. Inspect the exception to obtain root cause details.
|**ErrPathIsDuplicate**|SDK logs this error during document indexing process if it encounters a definition identified by a name that was already declared in the same document, for example, by having definition of "Task" entity twice in the same document.
|**ErrPathNullObjectPath**|This error is logged when SDK needs to load a document, calculate file modification time or create absolute corpus path from the given corpus path, but encounters a path that is null or empty. Ensure your document paths and partition locations are properly set. The object path cannot be null or empty.
|**ErrPersistAdapterNotFoundForNamespace**|While saving a document, SDK attempted to obtain the adapter associated with the namespace that a given document is part of, but could not find anything registered to this namespace. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound.
|**ErrPersistAdapterWriteFailure**|SDK logs this error when adapter does not have permission to write, for example if attempting to save back a document that was loaded from CdmStandardsAdapter.
|**ErrPersistCardinalityPropMissing**|SDK logs this error when creating entity attribute object from the definition document and finds a cardinality object that is missing minimum or maximum value. Correct the document to specify both values.
|**ErrPersistCdmEntityFetchError**|This error is logged when SDK fails to obtain entity definition document indicated in the supplied path of a local entity declaration in a manifest. There is variety of possible root causes for this situation, so inspect the preceding logs reported by the SDK. 
|**ErrPersistClassMissing**|SDK logs this error during loading or saving of a document when it cannot recognize the document type. Supported document types are "*.cdm.json", " manifest.cdm.json" and "model.json". Supported formats are model.json, manifest.cdm.json, and cdm.json.
|**ErrPersistConversionError**|This error is a catch-all error reported on manifest object level, issued when performing load from the file-system. Inspect the contained exception message and any other prior error messages to find possible root cause.
|**ErrPersistCsvProcessingError**|SDK logs this error when cs format passed are incorrect or missing. Csv should have columnHeaders, csvstyle, delimiter, quoteStyle, and encoding.
|**ErrPersistDeserializeError**|SDK logs this error when entity fails to deserialize. Reason logged in message. Check eventlist object to get more granular error codes.
|**ErrPersistDocConversionFailure**|This error is a catch-all error reported on manifest object level, issued when performing load from the file-system. Inspect the contained exception message and any other prior error messages to find possible root cause.
|**ErrPersistDocNameLoadFailure**|This error is logged while loading a document with an invalid file name. This is specific to model.json files, which must be named exactly that, any other file name, for example "foo.model.json", will get rejected.
|**ErrPersistEntityAttrUnsupported**|While loading entity, SDK found both a Projection and a Resolution Guidance set on the same entity attribute. In this situation, Projection takes precedence and the Resolution Guidance is skipped.
|**ErrPersistEntityDeclarationMissing**|This error is logged if a manifest document contains a declaration with non-recognizable "type" property value. The only supported entity declaration types are "LocalEntity" or "ReferencedEntity".
|**ErrPersistEntityPathNotFound**|The SDK will log this error if entity path is not set in the entity declaration in the document being loaded. Check the document content and add missing path(s).
|**ErrPersistFailure**|This error is logged while saving a document with an invalid file name. This is specific to model.json files, which must be named exactly that, any other file name, for example "foo.model.json", will get rejected.

|**ErrPersistFileWriteFailure**|SDK has encountered error(s) while saving the specified document. The common reasons include object serialization errors, I/O errors, invalid object paths, or adapter configuration saving errors. Inspect the contained exception message and any other prior error messages to find possible root cause.
|**ErrPersistInvalidMaxCardinality**|SDK logs this error when it tries to create entity attribute object but fails because of invalid maximum cardinality value. Ensure the value must be a number greater than zero or "*".
|**ErrPersistInvalidMinCardinality**|SDK logs this error when it tries to create entity attribute object but fails because of invalid minimum cardinality value. Ensure the value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than maximum cardinality.
|**ErrPersistJsonAttrContextConversionError**|SDK logs this error when it is not able to deserialize from JSON to an attribute context object. Inspect the contained exception message to find possible root cause.
|**ErrPersistJsonDatatypeConversionError**|SDK logs this error when it is not able to deserialize from JSON to a data type object because the JSON is null.

|**ErrPersistModelJsonModelIdDuplication**|SDK logs this error when loading model.json file if same reference model ID is pointing at different locations. Use unique IDs in all declared reference models.
|**ErrPersistModelJsonModelIdNotFound**|SDK logs this error when loading model.json file if a specified reference ID is not declared in the list of reference models. Ensure any reference ID used in the model.json is declared with an appropriate path under the "referenceModels" section.
|**ErrPersistModelJsonToAttrConversionFailure**|SDK logs this error when it tries to create CDM object from document but fails. Check entitylist object for more granular error code causing this.
|**ErrPersistNullDocName**|This error gets logged if SDK finds a document with a null or empty name while performing loading or saving activity. All document objects must have a name set. Document name cannot be null or empty.
|**ErrPersistObjectNotFound**|SDK logs this error when performing loading or saving of documents, if the specified path is not pointing at a valid document. Generally this happens if SDK is asked to load an invalid path, or save a document that has an import pointing at an invalid path. When investigating this problem, look for prior logged errors such as ErrPathNullObjectPath, ErrStorageNamespaceMismatch, ErrStorageInvalidPathFormat, ErrValdnInvalidDoc, and ErrDocSymbolNotFound.

|**ErrPersistSymsUnsupportedManifest**| SDK does not support saving databases.manifest.cdm.json file as it can cause performance issue on SyMS workspace.
|**ErrPersistSaveLinkedDocs**|SDK logs this error when it fails to save one or more linked (imported) documents. There may be variety of reasons, including imports with wrong paths to documents, absence of files or access limitations on the target location. Inspect prior error messages to find possible root cause.
|**ErrPersistUnsupportedJsonSemVer**|SDK reports this error during loading of a document, when it realizes its jsonSchemaSemanticVersion is higher than what this SDK accepts. Upgrading to a newer version of the SDK is advised. This ObjectModel version supports json semantic version {0} at maximum.
|**ErrProjFailedToResolve**|SDK logs this error when for any reason the projection context is not created correctly. It is a generic error that should be preceded by other error logs containing specific information about the kind of issue that lead to the projection context to be null. Failed to resolve a projection. Check previous logs to get more details.
|**ErrProjInvalidAttrState**|SDK logs this error occurs if a resolved attribute is null or if its name is null or an empty string.
|**ErrProjRefAttrStateFailure**|SDK logs this error when an attribute that is referenced by any operation within a projection cannot be found. Verify that the source entity or the prior operations introduce an attribute with the specified name.
|**ErrProjRenameFormatIsNotSet**|SDK logs this error if the "renameFormat" property of an renameAttributes operation is not set. Check the documentation for the operation [here](../sdk/projections/renameattributes.md).
|**ErrProjSourceError**|SDK logs this error if the source of a projection that is applied to a data typed attribute is anything other than another projection. If you want the source to point to another entity use an entity typed attribute instead.
|**ErrProjStringError**|SDK logs this error if either the minimum or maximum cardinality is not a valid number.
|**ErrProjUnsupportedAttrGroups**|This error is logged if an array expansion operation is applied to an attribute group.
|**ErrRelMaxResolvedAttrReached**|SDK logs this error during entity resolution process when the number of resolved attributes in an entity crosses the maximum number set in ResolveOptions.ResolvedAttributeLimit. Default limit is 4000, which is sufficient for general use. Before increasing this number, ensure you are aware of performance implications of allowing such large entities to be produced out of resolution process.
|**ErrResolutionFailure**|This error is logged when the data type of an argument of a trait reference does not match the expected data type specified on the trait definition.
|**ErrResolveEntityFailure**|This error is logged during resolution of a manifest when it is unable to fetch linked entity to perform its resolution. It may occur for variety of reasons, such as ErrPathNullObjectPath, ErrStorageNamespaceMismatch, ErrStorageInvalidPathFormat, ErrValdnInvalidDoc, or ErrDocSymbolNotFound. Inspect prior error messages to find possible root cause.
|**ErrResolveFolderNotFound**|SDK logs this error when it is not able to find folder to place the resolved entity in. There may be variety of reasons, including absence of folders, network problems and other.
|**ErrResolveManifestExists**|This error is logged when a manifest with the name provided already exists in the folder when attempting to resolve a manifest. Provide the `CreateResolvedManifestAsync` API with a different manifest name or remove the manifest that already exists.
|**ErrResolveManifestFailed**|This error is logged when the manifest for which resolution was requested has not been placed in a folder yet. Before calling `CreateResolvedManifestAsync` API, add the manifest to a CdmFolderDefinition representing the folder where this manifest should reside.
|**ErrResolveNewEntityNameNotSet**|SDK logs this error when new entity name has not been provided to `CreateResolvedEntityAsync` call.
|**ErrResolveReferenceFailure**|This error is logged during indexing of a document, when an object reference cannot be resolved to any known objects, and the ResolveOptions.ShallowValidation is set to False. Usual causes of this error are missing import of the document containing the object definition or misspelled object name.
|**ErrStorageAdapterNotFound**|SDK attempted to obtain adapter associated with namespace that the given corpus path is part of, but could not find it. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound. A
|**ErrStorageFolderNotFound**|SDK logs this error when there is no folder exist from the given namespace.
|**ErrStorageInvalidAdapterPath**|This error is reported when SDK attempts to convert given corpus path to an adapter path, but there was no adapter found that understood this corpus path. Make sure that all adapters the given schema relies on are mounted on the corpus object before loading the schema.
|**ErrStorageInvalidPathFormat**|SDK raises this error when the path does not start with '.\' or contains '..\' or '\.\'.
|**ErrStorageMissingJsonConfig**|This error is logged during mounting of adapters using provided configuration file, when adapter configuration property could not be found. This configuration file is invalid and needs to be corrected.
|**ErrStorageMissingNamespace**|This error is logged during mounting of adapters using provided configuration file, when adapter namespace property could not be found. This configuration file is invalid and needs to be corrected.
|**ErrStorageMissingTypeJsonConfig**|This error is logged during mounting of adapters using provided configuration file, when adapter type property could not be found. This configuration file is invalid and needs to be corrected.
|**ErrStorageNamespaceMismatch**|This error is logged when creating absolute corpus path using provided relative path and object, but the relative path and the provided object have different namespaces. Make sure path and object are located under the same namespace.
|**ErrStorageNamespaceNotRegistered**|SDK reports this error when provided corpus path has a namespace that has not been registered, meaning no adapter has been mounted to the specific namespace. Make sure that all namespaces have applicable adapters registered before loading documents or converting corpus paths.
|**ErrStorageNullAdapter**|SDK attempted to use adapter object but it was passed as null. Verify that the adapter object being mounted has been properly initialized.
|**ErrStorageNullAdapterConfig**|SDK logs this error when provided configuration from which adapters will be created is null. Verify that the adapter configuration string has been read properly from the file-system.
|**ErrStorageNullCorpusPath**|SDK logs this error when trying to parse corpus path either from an object or as supplied through public API, but the path is null. Make sure the objects have their corpus paths and that nulls are not passed as path arguments to the SDK's APIs.
|**ErrStorageNullNamespace**|This error is logged when namespace supplied to APIs to mount or unmount a namespace, or set or get registered adapter, or get namespace's root folder is null. Make sure to provide a correct namespace value to the SDK's APIs.
|**ErrStorageObjectNodeCastFailed**|SDK logs this error when the loaded config structure can't be mapped to objectNode. Usual root cause for this will be corruption of the config file. Check the exception message for more details.
|**ErrSymbolNotFound**|SDK logs this error when a symbol is being looked up but the document used as a point of reference has not been indexed and the ResolveOptions.ImportLoadStrategy is set to "DoNotLoad". Change the import load strategy to "Load" or "LazyLoad" to allow SDK to load and find the symbols.
|**ErrTraitArgumentMissing**|This error is logged during resolution, when SDK encounters a trait reference, which does not have arguments supplied for all of the required parameters defined in the trait definition. Check the trait definition and add missing arguments to the trait reference.
|**ErrTraitAttrFetchError**|SDK logs this error if it is unable to obtain attribute and its traits due to an unexpected exception. Check the exception for the root cause of the error.
|**ErrTraitResolutionFailure**|SDK logs this error if it is unable to resolve trait arguments due to an unexpected exception. Check the exception for the root cause of the error.
|**ErrUnexpectedDataType**|SDK logs this error when it encounters unexpected data type or zero type. Expected data types are entity, attribute, dataType, purpose, trait, and attributeGroup.
|**ErrUnexpectedType**|This error is logged when SDK finds symbol matching the given reference, but the type of the symbol is not matching the type of the reference. This can happen, for example, if a data type reference name is actually belonging to a purpose definition. Correct the reference object to point at the right matching definition.
|**ErrUnrecognizedDataType**|This error is logged when SDK checks trait parameters and finds an unrecognized data type. Usual causes of this error are missing import of the document containing the data type definition or misspelled data type name.
|**ErrUnsupportedRef**|This error is logged when SDK finds a symbol reference that appears to be absolute, starting with '/'. Correct the reference to start with a moniker name.
|**ErrUnsupportedType**|This error is logged when "defaultValue" property of an attribute is not a JSON array. Check the property and change its type accordingly.
|**ErrValdnIntegrityCheckFailure**|SDK logs this error when performing validation of the model and encounters objects that are not properly set. Check the message to find which information needs to be supplied for the specific object. Integrity check failed. The object '{0}' is missing the following fields: {1}
|**ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath**|SDK logs this error when corpus path in a document is not valid. This can usually occur after errors ErrPathNullObjectPath, ErrStorageInvalidPathFormat, or ErrStorageNamespaceMismatch.
|**ErrValdnInvalidDoc**|This error is logged when retrieving a document from the given path, but the document failed validation during the indexing process. Check prior errors logged by the SDK for potential root causes.
|**ErrValdnInvalidExpression**|This error is logged during parsing of a regular expression or glob pattern supplied in a Data Partition Pattern. Check the exception message for possible root cause.
|**ErrValdnInvalidMaxCardinality**|SDK logs this error when it tries to create entity attribute object but fails because of invalid maximum cardinality value. Ensure the value must is a number greater than zero or "*".
|**ErrValdnInvalidMinCardinality**|SDK logs this error when it tries to create entity attribute object but fails because of invalid minimum cardinality value. Ensure the value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than maximum cardinality.
|**ErrValdnMissingDoc**|Reported during indexing process when SDK encounters a document that has not been placed in any folder. To correct this, ensure all document definitions objects have been added to appropriate folder definition objects before indexing triggers.
|**ErrValdnMissingLanguageTag**|This error is logged when a defaultValue property does not have any entries in the array, or an entry is missing "languageTag" and "displayText" values.


## Warnings 
|Enum|Description|
|---|---|
|**WarnAnnotationTypeNotSupported**|SDK logs this warning when loading model.json file, when argument type provided in trait "is.modelConversion.otherAnnotations" is neither JObject nor a pair of "name" and "value" properties. Correct the argument accordingly to correct this warning.
|**WarnDocChangesDiscarded**|SDK logs this warning if a document had unsaved changes in it, but a request to reload this document was received. Any changes to the document will in this situation be discarded. Make sure to save updated documents before loading them again.
|**WarnDocImportNotLoaded**|This error is logged when an import was not resolved to any document. This may be due to variety of reasons, such as import having wrong path, document missing in the file-system, access permissions, and others. Check the prior logs for potential root causes.
|**WarnLinkEntIdentArgsNotSupported**|This warning is logged during resolution, if trait "is.linkedEntity.identifier" does not accept any arguments. This trait is used to record foreign key (linked entity) information. When this situation occurs, SDK will skip recording of the relationship information for the resolved foreign key attribute. Check definition of the trait to ensure it is properly structured and accepting relationship information arguments.
|**WarnPartitionFileFetchFailed**|This warning is logged while performing lookup of partitions on the target file-system, when an unexpected exception prevents from retrieving complete list of partitions and their details. The exception message will contain additional details about the root cause. Make sure the partition root location and pattern are correctly set and that the appropriate access level is available for accessing the partition files.
|**WarnPartitionGlobAndRegexPresent**|This warning is logged if a Data Partition Pattern has both regular expression and glob pattern properties set. In this situation glob pattern is used and regular expression ignored.
|**WarnPartitionInvalidArguments**|SDK logs this warning during creation of Data Partition Definition object from a document, when the argument attached to the partition in the document is malformed, for example if "key" or "value" properties are missing. Check the document and correct the partition object arguments.
|**WarnPersistCustomExtNotSupported**|This warning is logged if SDK encounters a referenced entity in a document with custom extension traits attached. This is not supported and all such traits should be removed from the mentioned referenced entity.
|**WarnPersistEntityMissing**|This warning is logged if an entity in the model does not have an owner set, or the owner is set but it is not of Document type. Make sure to all entity definitions are added to document objects.
|**WarnPersistEnumNotFound**|This warning is logged while loading type attribute from the document, when the "dataFormat" property is set to a non-recognizable value. Correct the value to be one of the values supported by the CdmDataFormat enumeration [here](../1.0om/api-reference/cdm/dataformat.md)
|**WarnPersistFileModTimeFailure**|This warning is logged during computation of last modified time of a document currently being loaded when SDK encounters an exception. Check the exception message for possible root cause.
|**WarnPersistFileReadFailure**|SDK logs this warning when attempting to load a document from a file-system via corresponding adapter, but encounters an exception. This is usually I/O related and possible root cause may be found in the exception details.
|**WarnPersistJsonSemVerInvalidFormat**|SDK logs this warning when "jsonSchemaSemanticVersion" property of a document has invalid format. Correct format is "{major}.{minor}.{patch}".
|**WarnPersistJsonSemVerMandatory**|This warning is logged when SDK loads a document and does not find "jsonSchemaSemanticVersion" property set in it. In this case, SDK will still attempt to load the document, but if there are unsupported features encountered that the parser cannot deal with, errors will get reported.
|**WarnPersistModelJsonRelReadFailed**|SDK logs this warning when loading relationships from model.json file, when one of the relationships is not properly defined. This warning is usually reported after warnings WarnPersistRelUndefinedSourceEntity and WarnPersistRelUndefinedTargetEntity. Check the model.json's relationships list and correct entries that are missing the specific properties.
|**WarnPersistPartitionLocMissing**|This warning is logged when SDK encounters a partition that does not have a location set. Ensure the location property is set in each partition.
|**WarnPersistPartitionNameNull**|SDK logs this warning when saving manifest to model.json format, but finds a partition object that doesn't have name property set. Partition names are mandatory in model.json format, so the SDK will in this situation use empty string as the name.
|**WarnPersistRelUndefinedSourceEntity**|SDK logs this warning when loading relationships from model.json file, when one of the relationships is missing source entity name. Check the model.json's relationships list and correct entries that are missing this property.
|**WarnPersistRelUndefinedTargetEntity**|SDK logs this warning when loading relationships from model.json file, when one of the relationships is missing target entity name. Check the model.json's relationships list and correct entries that are missing this property.
|**WarnPersistSymsEntityMissing**| SDK logs this warning if entity is missing.
|**WarnPersistSymsEntitySkipped**| SDK logs this warning when it skips entity creation. This could occur if file format type is not csv or storage descriptor received from SyMS does not have location.
|**WarnPersistSymsProjNotExist**| SDK logs this warning when it finds projection in document. CDM-SyMS works on resolve model.
|**WarnPersistUnsupportedJsonSemVer**|SDK reports this warning during loading of a document, when it realizes its jsonSchemaSemanticVersion is higher than what this SDK accepts. Upgrading to a newer version of the SDK is advised.
|**WarnProjRenameAttrNotSupported**|SDK logs this warning when it tries to rename an attribute group, but this action is currently not supported. Avoid running rename operation over attribute groups.
|**WarnResolveAttrFailed**|The Object Model supports a path that is a promise to a resolved attribute. The path follows the format {entityName}/(resolvedAttributes)/{attributeName}. This warning is logged if the OM can find the entity but within its attributes it cannot find the "attributeName" provided.
|**WarnResolveEntityFailed**|SDK logs this warning when it fails to resolve entity from the given reference.
|**WarnResolveImportFailed**|SDL logs this warning when import resolution fails. There may be variety of reasons causing this issue, such as wrong import paths, missing documents on the target file-system, access permissions and others. Check prior logged messages for possible root cause.
|**WarnResolveObjectFailed**|This warning is logged when SDK fails to find object by the name given in the reference. Usual causes of this are missing import of the document containing the object definition or misspelled object name.
|**WarnResolveReferenceFailure**|This warning is logged during indexing of a document, when an object reference cannot be resolved to any known objects, and the ResolveOptions.ShallowValidation is set to True. Usual causes of this error are missing import of the document containing the object definition or misspelled object name.
|**WarnStorageExpectedPathPrefix**|This warning is logged if a folder path of an object does not end with '/'. SDK will auto-correct this by appending the '/' symbol to the folder path.
|**WarnStorageRemoveAdapterFailed**|SDK logs this warning when unmounting of a non-existent namespace has been requested. Make sure a valid namespace value has been provided to the API.
|**WarnValdnEntityNotDefined**|SDK logs this warning when it encounters a Constant entity without a constant value. Make sure to supply constant values after defining a Constant entity object.
|**WarnValdnMaxOrdinalTooHigh**|This warning is logged if the "EndOrdinal" property of an array expansion operation is bigger than the maximum allowed ordinal provided in the ResolveOptions.MaxOrdinalForArrayExpansion property.
|**WarnValdnPrimaryKeyMissing**|SDK logs this warning when a resolved entity does not have an "is.identifiedBy" trait, which means that there was no primary key defined in the entity. Usually this is not a valid scenario, and introducing a primary key in the specified entity is a proper corrective action.
|**WarnDeprecatedResolutionGuidance**|SDK logs this warning is logged on `CreateResolvedEntityAsync` if resolution guidance is used anywhere on the logical entity.
|**WarnProjAddArtifactAttrNotSupported**|SDK logs this warning if the attribute supplied to the AddArtifactAttribute operation is not a Data Type Attribute.
|**WarnProjCreateForeignKeyTraits**|SDK logs this warning to indicate an internal error where an attribute does not have the owner property set.
|**WarnProjFKWithoutSourceEntity**|This warning is logged if a replaceAsForeignKey operation is used while extending an entity or on an data typed attribute. This operation is only allowed on an entity typed attribute.
|**WarnTelemetryIngestionFailed**|This warning is logged when the Kusto ingestion process throws an exception due to authentication failure or HTTP request failure.
|**WarnTelemetryMaxQueueSizeReached**|This warning is logged when the Kusto ingestion fails because ingestion queue reaches its maximum size.
|**WarnValdnOrdinalStartEndOrder**|This warning is logged if the "StartOrdinal" of an array expansion operation is smaller than the "EndOrdinal". In that case the operation will not execute.
