# Guidance on SDK error and warning codes

The following list describes the possible error and warning codes logged by the Common Data Model SDK with their description.
These error and warning codes are defined in [CdmLogcode](../1.0om/api-reference/cdm/logcode.md) enum class.

## Errors 
|Enum|Description|
|---|---|
|**ErrAdapterNotFound**|SDK attempted to obtain adapter associated with namespace that the given document is part of, but could not find it. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound
|**ErrDocAdapterNotFound**|SDK attempted to obtain adapter associated with the namespace that the given document is part of, but could not find it. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound.
|**ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure**|SDK was unable to save documents containing definitions of local or partition-specialized entities. This error is usually reported after errors ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound and ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocEntityReplacementFailure**|This error occurs during resolution of an entity if the document where the resolved entity is going to be saved already exists. To avoid this error, you can specify non-conflicting resolved document name (if calling CreateResolvedEntityAsync) or document rename pattern (if calling CreateResolvedManifestAsync).
|**ErrDocImportSavingFailure**|SDK was unable to save one or more documents imported by the document currently being saved. This error is usually reported after errors ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound and ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocIsNotFolder**|This error occurs when one of the entities in a manifest being resolved is part of a document that is not placed in any CDM virtual folder. This situation may occur when composing a new manifest and adding entities but omitting to place entity documents to a CDM folder before the resolution is started.
|**ErrDocPartitionSchemaSavingFailure**|SDK logs this error when it fails to save partition schema document. This error is usually reported after ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound or ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocSubManifestSavingFailure**|SDK logs this error when it fails to save submanifest document. This error usually reported after ErrValdnInvalidCorpusPath, ErrPersistObjectNotFound or ErrDocEntityDocSavingFailure.
|**ErrDocSymbolNotFound**|This error is logged by FetchObjectAsync API when it is not able to find the specified object. This may happen if the supplied path is incorrect, or the document on the target file-system cannot be loaded.
|**ErrDocWrtDocNotfound**|SDK logs this error when resolving an entity if WrtDoc property in the ResolveOptions object is not set. The WRT stands for "with regard to" and is the document SDK should use as a point of reference when resolving relative paths and symbol names encountered in the definitions.
|**ErrEntityCreationFailed**|This error is logged during addition of an entity definition to a manifest if the supplied entity object does not have Owner set. An 'owner' for an entity definition object should be a document, therefore make sure to add entity definition to a document before the entity is added to a manifest.
|**ErrIndexFailed**|This error is reported during document indexing process. A common situation is if a document object exists that has not been added to any folder object yet, indicated by the preceeding ErrValdnMissingDoc error.
|**ErrInvalidPath**|SDK logs this error when attempting to fetch child folders for the given path, but detects discrepancy between the indicated path names and the folder objects names, e.g. path is "/foo/bar" but folders objects are defined as folder("foo").folder("qux").
|**ErrObjectWithoutOwnerFound**|SDK logs this error during searching for entity to entity relationships when object containing the target entity is missing.
|**ErrPartitionFileModTimeFailure**|This error is reported during computation of the last modified time of a partition, when SDK accesses file-system via applicable adapter but encounters an exception, usually I/O related. Possible reasons can be wrong partition paths, wrong adapter configurations, access permissions, temporary network failures, and others. Inspect the exception to obtain root cause details.
|**ErrPathIsDuplicate**|SDK logs this error during document indexing process if it encounters a definition identified by a name that was already declared in the same document, e.g. by having definition of "Task" entity twice in the same document.
|**ErrPathNullObjectPath**|This error is logged when SDK needs to load a document, calculate file modification time or create absolute corpus path from the given corpus path, but encounters a path that is null or empty. Ensure your document paths and partition locations are properly set. The object path cannot be null or empty.
|**ErrPersistAdapterNotFoundForNamespace**|While saving a document, SDK attempted to obtain the adapter associated with the namespace that a given document is part of, but could not find anything registered to this namespace. This error is usually reported after errors ErrStorageNullNamespace and ErrStorageAdapterNotFound.
|**ErrPersistAdapterWriteFailure**|SDK logs this error when adapter does not have permission to write, for example if attempting to save back a document that was loaded from CdmStandardsAdapter.
|**ErrPersistCardinalityPropMissing**|SDK logs this error when creating entity attribute object from the definition document and finds a cardinality object that is missing minimum or maximum value. Please correct the document to specify both values.
|**ErrPersistCdmEntityFetchError**|This error is logged when SDK fails to obtain entity definition document indicated in the supplied path of a local entity declaration in a manifest. There is variety of possible root causes for this situation, so please inspect the preceding logs reported by the SDK. 
|**ErrPersistClassMissing**|SDK logs this error during loading or saving of a document when it cannot recognize the document type. Supported document types are "*.cdm.json", " manifest.cdm.json" and "model.json". Supported formats are model.json, manifest.cdm.json and cdm.json.

|**ErrProjUnsupportedAttrGroups**|This error is logged if an array expansion operation is applied to an attribute group.
|**ErrRelMaxResolvedAttrReached**|SDK logs this error during entity resolution process when the number of resolved attributes in an entity crosses the maximum number set in ResolveOptions.ResolvedAttributeLimit. Default limit is 4000, which is sufficient for general use. Before increasing this number, ensure you are aware of performance implications of allowing such large entities to be produced out of resolution process.
|**ErrResolutionFailure**|This error is logged when the data type of an argument of a trait reference does not match the expected data type specified on the trait definition.
|**ErrResolveEntityFailure**|This error is logged during resolution of a manifest when it is unable to fetch linked entity to perform its resolution. It may occur for variety of reasons, such as ErrPathNullObjectPath, ErrStorageNamespaceMismatch, ErrStorageInvalidPathFormat, ErrValdnInvalidDoc or ErrDocSymbolNotFound. Please inspect prior error messages to find possible root cause.

## Warnings 
|Enum|Description|
|---|---|
|**WarnAnnotationTypeNotSupported**|SDK logs this warning when loading model.json file, when argument type provided in trait "is.modelConversion.otherAnnotations" is neither JObject nor a pair of "name" and "value" properties. Please correct the argument accordingly to correct this warning.
|**WarnDocChangesDiscarded**|SDK logs this warning if a document had unsaved changes in it, but a request to reload this document was received. Any changes to the document will in this situation be discarded. Make sure to save updated documents before loading them again.
|**WarnDocImportNotLoaded**|This error is logged when an import was not resolved to any document. This may be due to variety of reasons, such as import having wrong path, document missing in the file-system, access permissions, and others. Please check the prior logs for potential root causes.
|**WarnLinkEntIdentArgsNotSupported**|This warning is logged during resolution, if trait "is.linkedEntity.identifier" does not accept any arguments. This trait is used to record foreign key (linked entity) information. When this situation occurs, SDK will skip recording of the relationship information for the resolved foreign key attribute. Please check definition of the trait to ensure it is properly structured and accepting relationship information arguments.
|**WarnPartitionFileFetchFailed**|This warning is logged while performing lookup of partitions on the target file-system, when an unexpected exception prevents from retrieving complete list of partitions and their details. The exception message will contain additional details about the root cause. Make sure the partition root location and pattern are correctly set and that the appropriate access level is available for accessing the partition files.
|**WarnPartitionGlobAndRegexPresent**|This warning is logged if a Data Partition Pattern has both regular expression and glob pattern properties set. In this situation glob pattern is used and regular expression ignored.
|**WarnPartitionInvalidArguments**|SDK logs this warning during creation of Data Partition Definition object from a document, when the argument attached to the partition in the document is malformed, for example if "key" or "value" properties are missing. Please check the document and correct the partition object arguments.
|**WarnPersistCustomExtNotSupported**|This warning is logged if SDK encounters a referenced entity in a document with custom extension traits attached. This is not supported and all such traits should be removed from the mentioned referenced entity.
|**WarnPersistEntityMissing**|This warning is logged if an entity in the model does not have an owner set, or the owner is set but it is not of Document type. Make sure to all entity definitions are added to document objects.
|**WarnPersistEnumNotFound**|This warning is logged while loading type attribute from the document, when the "dataFormat" property is set to a non-recognizable value. Please correct the value to be one of the values supported by the CdmDataFormat enumeration [here](../1.0om/api-reference/cdm/dataformat.md)
|**WarnPersistFileModTimeFailure**|This warning is logged during computation of last modified time of a document currently being loaded when SDK encounters an exception. Please check the exception message for possible root cause.
|**WarnPersistFileReadFailure**|SDK logs this warning when attempting to load a document from a file-system via corresponding adapter, but encounters an exception. This is usually I/O related and possible root cause may be found in the exception details.
|**WarnPersistJsonSemVerInvalidFormat**|SDK logs this warning when "jsonSchemaSemanticVersion" property of a document has invalid format. Correct format is "{major}.{minor}.{patch}".
|**WarnPersistJsonSemVerMandatory**|This warning is logged when SDK loads a document and does not find "jsonSchemaSemanticVersion" property set in it. In this case, SDK will still attempt to load the document, but if there are unsupported features encountered that the parser cannot deal with, errors will get reported.
|**WarnPersistModelJsonRelReadFailed**|SDK logs this warning when loading relationships from model.json file, when one of the relationships is not properly defined. This warning is usually reported after warnings WarnPersistRelUndefinedSourceEntity and WarnPersistRelUndefinedTargetEntity. Please check the model.json's relationships list and correct entries that are missing the specific properties.
|**WarnPersistPartitionLocMissing**|This warning is logged when SDK encounters a partition that does not have a location set. Please ensure the location property is set in each partition.
|**WarnPersistPartitionNameNull**|SDK logs this warning when saving manifest to model.json format, but finds a partition object that doesn't have name property set. Partition names are mandatory in model.json format, so the SDK will in this situation use empty string as the name.
|**WarnPersistRelUndefinedSourceEntity**|SDK logs this warning when loading relationships from model.json file, when one of the relationships is missing source entity name. Please check the model.json's relationships list and correct entries that are missing this property.
|**WarnPersistRelUndefinedTargetEntity**|SDK logs this warning when loading relationships from model.json file, when one of the relationships is missing target entity name. Please check the model.json's relationships list and correct entries that are missing this property.
|**WarnPersistSymsEntityMissing**| SDK logs this warning entity is missing.
|**WarnPersistSymsProjNotExist**| SDK logs this warning when it finds projection in document. CDM-SyMS works on resolve model.
|**WarnPersistUnsupportedJsonSemVer**|SDK reports this warning during loading of a document, when it realizes its jsonSchemaSemanticVersion is higher than what this SDK accepts. Upgrading to a newer version of the SDK is strongly advised.
|**WarnProjRenameAttrNotSupported**|SDK logs this warning when it tries to rename an attribute group, but this action is currently not supported. Please avoid running rename operation over attribute groups.
|**WarnResolveAttrFailed**|The Object Model supports a path that is a promise to a resolved attribute. The path follows the format {entityName}/(resolvedAttributes)/{attributeName}. This warning is logged if the OM can find the entity but within its attributes it cannot find the "attributeName" provided.
|**WarnResolveEntityFailed**|SDK logs this warning when it fails to resolve entity from the given reference.
|**WarnResolveImportFailed**|SDL logs this warning when import resolution fails. There may be variety of reasons causing this issue, such as wrong import paths, missing documents on the target file-system, access permissions and others. Please check prior logged messages for possible root cause.
|**WarnResolveObjectFailed**|This warning is logged when SDK fails to find object by the name given in the reference. Usual causes of this are missing import of the document containing the object definition or misspelled object name.
|**WarnResolveReferenceFailure**|This warning is logged during indexing of a document, when an object reference cannot be resolved to any known objects, and the ResolveOptions.ShallowValidation is set to True. Usual causes of this error are missing import of the document containing the object definition or misspelled object name.
|**WarnStorageExpectedPathPrefix**|This warning is logged if a folder path of an object does not end with '/'. SDK will auto-correct this by appending the '/' symbol to the folder path.
|**WarnStorageRemoveAdapterFailed**|SDK logs this warning when unmounting of a non-existent namespace has been requested. Make sure a valid namespace value has been provided to the API.
|**WarnValdnEntityNotDefined**|SDK logs this warning when it encounters a Constant entity without a constant value. Make sure to supply constant values after defining a Constant entity object.
|**WarnValdnMaxOrdinalTooHigh**|This warning is logged if the "EndOrdinal" property of an array expansion operation is bigger than the maximum allowed ordinal provided in the ResolveOptions.MaxOrdinalForArrayExpansion property.
