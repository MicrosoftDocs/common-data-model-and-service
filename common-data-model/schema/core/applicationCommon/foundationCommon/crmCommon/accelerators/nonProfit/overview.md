## Entities

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|[Account](Account.md)|Business that represents a customer or potential customer. The company that is billed in business transactions.|
|[Address](Address.md)|Address and shipping information. Used to store additional addresses for an account or contact.|
|[Award](Award.md)|The total amount of funding that has been agreed to be awarded to an individual or institution and related data, including but not limited to the recipient, date of the award, and purpose of the award|
|[AwardVersion](AwardVersion.md)|A point in time snapshot of the attributes of an Award.|
|[Budget](Budget.md)|Amount of funds that can be designated for an Objective and/or Delivery Framework (i.e. Program, Project) for a given period of time.|
|[Campaign](Campaign.md)|Container for campaign activities and responses, sales literature, products, and lists to create, plan, execute, and track the results of a specific marketing campaign through its life.|
|[Contact](Contact.md)|Person with whom a business unit has a relationship, such as customer, supplier, and colleague.|
|[CreditPlan](CreditPlan.md)|Credit Plans control who will be credited with hard or soft credits after a payment clears. A credit plan could "counted" for membership or other benefit prior to a payment actually being cleared. A Credit Plan shows up as a A line item attached to a Pledge, Payment Schedule, or Account .  The goal of a credit plan is to avoid the double counting of hard, soft and split crediting.  The most elegant way to manage Credit Plan is by ensuring there are business rules in place like an "auto" soft credit rule attached to Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities or Donor Commitments depending on the conditions met.  Credit Plans can be countable toward fulfilling a benefit even if they are never fully realized as a hard or soft credit.|
|[CreditRecipient](CreditRecipient.md)|The contact, donor or constitiuent who receives "credit" for the hard or soft cleared payment.  A credit plan is always tied to a recipient in order to ensure full reconciliation and accounting of donations.  All nonprofits have business rules in place to govern how hard and soft credits are applied, but these rules are notoriously inconsistent from organization to organization.  For example, 6 of 12 enterprise nonprofits we recently surveyed about how they handle third party (corporate) giving crediting soft credit the corporation and hard credit the individual donors, whereas the other 6 surveyed nonprofits hard credit the third party providing the matching gift payments (i.e., Benevity is an example of a third party gift management company).  Still other organizations hard credit the corporation themselves.  For example, if Jane Smith donates $50 through her company Microsoft, and Microsoft matches the gift dollar for dollar, but Benevity collects and distributes the gift to Oxfam International, where is hard and soft credit applied?  Some organizations hard credit Jane Smith $100 ($50 donated plus the $50 match).  Some organizations hard credit Jane Smith $50 and Microsoft $50.  Some orgs hard credit Microsoft $100. And still more orgs hard credit Benevity some or all of the $100 donation.|
|[DeliveryFramework](DeliveryFramework.md)|A Delivery Framework is a Management Unit of work defined by the organization or entity doing the work.|
|[DesignatedCredit](DesignatedCredit.md)|A segment of a donation payment or in-kind gift that indicating the partial amount that is hard- or soft-credited to a Customer and allocated to one Designation.|
|[Designation](Designation.md)|An area to which funds may be allocated, including a GL-relevant accounting code.  Designations are the way a donor instructs an organization about how their donation should be spent or earmarked.  All nonprofit organizations strive to secure the largest % of unrestricted or undesignated funds possible so they can use this money at their own discretion toward the areas of greatest need, including the ability to pay down their operating costs.  Direct marketing-oriented nonprofits, and nonprofits with missions aligned to cause, cure, and global issues (like Oxfam) tend to have as few designations as they possibly can (~100-200 total designations) because they derive the majority of their funds from donors giving small gift amounts.  They also focus on recurring giving programs, which have a high administration cost if gifts are permitted to be designated or split designated across multiple funds.  A Higher Education organization, on the other hand, derives a large % of its annual fundraising from major donors, who typically want much more control about where they are directing their gifts.|
|[DesignationPlan](DesignationPlan.md)|A line item attached to a Pledge, Payment Schedule, or Campaign indicating how associated payments should be designated.  Sometimes, 100% of a donation is designated to a single fund (ideally, to an unrestricted fund that the nonprofit can use any way they wish).  Other times, a donor has specified a desire that the donation be "split designated" among two or more funds.  For example, a donor giving $5,000 might specify that $1000 goes to the unrestricted fund $1000 to the new building fund and $3000 to building water wells Sub-saharan Africa.|
|[Disbursement](Disbursement.md)|A Disbursement represents an Award disbursement to an individual or organizational awardee.  A Disbursement is related to a specific Award and Budget through a Disbursement Distribution.|
|[DisbursementDistribution](DisbursementDistribution.md)|Defines the Delivery Framework(s) - i.e. Program, Project, Initiative - that contribute to funding an Award Disbursement.|
|[Docket](Docket.md)|A Docket is used to associate inquiries (LOIs) and requests with a specific grant/award cycle or date (usually a review/board meeting) on which a foundation will make final decisions on applications.|
|[DonorCommitment](DonorCommitment.md)|Donor commitments track the frequency with which constituents donate funds to a nonprofit or Foundation.  All nonprofits and Foundations seek to attract as many monthly/recurring/sustaining gifts or donor commitments that they can.  Other donors routinely give on a one-time basis.  Monthly givers require additional payment and transaction information tracking including payment method, schedules, in-kind pledge relevance, and more.|
|[Education](Education.md)|Biographical information about the education institutions a contact attended or is attending, the areas of study (major/minor) concentrated on, activities and roles served, preferences (football booster, patron of the on-campus art museum, etc.), and the start and end dates associated with this information.  It's particularly important for mid-level and major gift fundraisers based in the United States to understand someone's university/college alumni/alumnae network and peers in order to build a bigger qualified prospect pipeline.  University/college association is not as relevant or important in the UK, for example, compared to the US.  Nonprofit organizations with a bigger focus on major gifts care more about tracking educational information at a deeper level.|
|[EmploymentHistory](EmploymentHistory.md)|Historical and/or current information about where a contact works, volunteers or serves in some capacity at an organization.  For nonprofits, tracking employer information is critical for a few reasons: it is important to understand if the employee is part of a eligible matching gift program, to have visibility into an employee's "network" and to visualize the degrees of separation between an employee and other prospective donors that the organization wants to solicit, and more.|
|[Indicator](Indicator.md)|An Indicator describes what will be measured to track evidence of a Result. Indicators can be qualitative or quantitative and may or may not be aggregable.|
|[IndicatorValue](IndicatorValue.md)|A quantitative or qualitative value of measurement of an Indicator|
|[Lead](Lead.md)|Prospect or potential sales opportunity. Leads are converted into accounts, contacts, or opportunities when they are qualified. Otherwise, they are deleted or archived.|
|[Objective](Objective.md)|Used for the purpose of reporting on goals or strategies outside of program boundaries.  For example, "Advocacy" may be an objective of both "Health Care" and "Education". An objective is often a step above program in terms of hierarchy.  So, a Foundation may have 5 key objectives to fund for a particular fiscal year.  Related and underneath objectives like Advocacy, Job Training, and Literarcy might be any number of additional, related programs, all of which are seeking to award grants to qualified grant seekers.|
|[OfacMatch](OfacMatch.md)|Prospective, pending and closed "deals" or gifts.  This entity allows nonprofit organizations to track their efforts to build relationships with prospective donors.   The following information is commonly tracked on opportunities:  assigned fundraiser(s), ask amounts, campaigns designated funds given to, etc.   Opportunity pipeline management allows development and gift officers to forecast likely gifts by when they are going to close, very similar to the way a salesperson tracks and manages sales opportunities.  It must be possible in a CRM or application to associate an opportunity to a campaign to measure the ROI of specific marketing programs.|
|[Opportunity](Opportunity.md)|Potential revenue-generating event, or sale to an account, which needs to be tracked through a sales process to completion.|
|[PaymentAsset](PaymentAsset.md)|Specific types of payments, including in-kind gifts, stock and securities that are classified as assets require non-profits to follow specific reporting rules.  Managing these gifts tends to be very manual work for nonprofit development operations staff.  These gifts come in through a bank, must be manually reviewed and entered into a batch.  Often there are questions that need to be answered before a gift entry can be completed with ease.|
|[PaymentMethod](PaymentMethod.md)|This is a parent entity for Payment Method customizations that may be supported by an application.  Possible extensions could be to support credit cards, EFT, cryptocurrency, mobile payments, or rewards points.|
|[PaymentProcessor](PaymentProcessor.md)|This is a placeholder entity referenced by the Payment Method object.  It is intended to be customized with configuration data necessary to connect to a payment processor and authorize payments.|
|[PaymentSchedule](PaymentSchedule.md)|A gift transaction can be a one-time payment or a recurring payment (ie, monthly/sustainer giving). In addition, it can be a pledge (ie, promise) of a future payment or a current/received payment.|
|[PlannedGiving](PlannedGiving.md)|A planned gift is a major gift made during a donor's lifetime or at the time of their death that involves their estate and tax planning.  There are many forms of planned giving, but the three most common vehicles are CRTs (Charitable Remainder Trusts), Bequests and Annuities, which all have different tax benefits and financial reconciliation guidelines for the nonprofit organization. Planned gifts are in contrast to annual gifts, which are made through a donor's discretionary income and not tied to an estate.|
|[Preference](Preference.md)|Typically tracks an abundance of constituent or organization information that doesn't live cleanly on an account or contact record, or that can be associated with both an Account and a Contact.  Examples:  personal interests, additional communication preferences like desire to receive a newsletter, specific outreach the constituent wants, and additional affiliation information like Constituent Type associations and ratings.|
|[Recommendation](Recommendation.md)|This is the mechanism through which Foundations provide recommendations back to a grant applicant.|
|[Report](Report.md)|A status report submitted by an awardee to the granting entity (i.e., a Foundation) to report on what impact has been accomplished to date through the funds awarded to them.|
|[Request](Request.md)|Represents a request from an individual or institution for funding or support. A request is more formal than an inquiry (LOI) and typically happens after an inquiry has already occurred.|
|[Result](Result.md)|A Result is a container that represents the changes in the context in which an organization operates Delivery Frameworks (i.e. Programs, Projects).|
|[Review](Review.md)|The internal assessment of a Request made by a staff member (or team) and all of the relevant information that needs to be tracked at the "review" stage of an application.|
|[Salutation](Salutation.md)|The way a donor or prospect is commonly addressed via written communication (lhard-copy letters, emails, etc.).  It is typical for nonprofits and foundations to address major donors by different salutations depending on the scenario.  A Medical Doctor could be addressed as "Doctor" when the organization reaches out regarding in-country field volunteerism the person performs.  On the other hand, the same individual might be referred to as Mrs. Smith as part of her household being solicited for a major gift.|
|[Transaction](Transaction.md)|Transactions (also referred to as donations) represent payments from the donor, contact, account or organization to the nonprofit.  Transaction records must track valuable information about the gift or items transferred from a constituent to a nonprofit organization.  Critical transaction information to capture and provide audit capabilities around include what payment method was used, what channel the gift came in through, whether an adjustment was made (and on what date for what amount?), when was the transaction received vs. processed vs. reconciled and more.|
