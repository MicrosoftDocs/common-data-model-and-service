# Overview of Workflow
The workflow module focuses on the coordination of activities within and across systems. This includes three primary aspects:

- How do we ask for another person, device or system to do something?
- How do we track the linkages and dependencies between activities - actions to their authorizations, complex activities to individual steps, protocols to plans to orders, etc.?
- How do we define what activities are possible and the expected order and dependencies of the steps within those activities? I.e. process/orchestration definition
