# Overview of Administration
The Administrative module covers the base data that is then linked into the other modules for clinical content, finance/billing, workflow, etc.
It is built on the FHIR technology platform modules.

Before any clinical data can be recorded, the basic information of the patient must be recorded, and then often the basis of the interaction (such as an encounter).
